# Command-Line Programming Languages

## Introduction

I've started reading a book called [Command-Line Rust](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/command-line-rust/9781098109424/)
by `Ken Youens-Clark`. The book teaches you Rust by building command-line applications.
I really like the book. I typically learn better through projects, so I decided to use
this book as a guide to not just learn Rust, but also any other programming language I
want to learn in the future. I'm going to use this site to document my progress.

## Programming languages in this book

This book currently contains the following programming languages:

- [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/languages/csharp)
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

I plan to add the following languages to this book in the future:

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [C++](https://isocpp.org/) (maybe)
